🖼️ Pic Discover App – Search and Explore Beautiful Images with Unsplash API
Hey DEV community! 👋

I'm excited to share a fun and visually engaging project I recently built – Pic Discover App 🎉

It’s a simple and responsive web app that lets users search and browse stunning images using the Unsplash API.

🔍 What Is Pic Discover?
Pic Discover is a web-based image search engine where users can:

🔎 Type in any keyword (e.g., mountains, cats, coding)
🖼️ Instantly see high-quality photos from Unsplash
➕ Load more results with a "Show More" button
📱 Enjoy a responsive design across desktop and mobile
It’s ideal for photographers, designers, bloggers, or anyone looking for image inspiration.

🛠️ Built With
✅ HTML – Semantic layout
🎨 CSS – Fully responsive and stylish UI with hover animations
⚙️ JavaScript – Fetching and rendering images dynamically
🌐 Unsplash API – Free access to a huge collection of images
📸 App Features
✨ Real-time image search based on user input
🧭 Pagination with “Show More” feature
💡 Auto-clears previous results when a new search begins
🎯 Clickable image links that redirect to the full image on Unsplash
🧼 Clean and minimal UI with smooth animations
🚀 How It Works
User types a keyword in the input box
The app calls the Unsplash Search API with that query
Images are displayed dynamically using JavaScript
Users can click "Show More" to fetch the next page of results

🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me understand:

How to work with third-party APIs
Making asynchronous requests using fetch()
DOM manipulation and dynamic rendering in vanilla JS
Creating a responsive layout with media queries
Optimizing UX with pagination and loading controls
💡 Future Improvements
Add loading spinners
Add dark/light theme toggle
Allow users to download or favorite images
Save recent search history in local storage
🙌 Final Thoughts
Pic Discover App was a great way to dive deeper into frontend development while building something interactive and useful.

If you’re looking to learn APIs or just want a fun UI project, try recreating this — it’s a rewarding experience!
